A Number Guessing game with Python and Three JS
===========================================

Welcome to the Number Guessing Game built using the Django Framework. This game randomly chooses a number between 0 and 999 and allows the user to make guesses until they guess the correct number. With each incorrect guess, the program gives a hint whether the number is greater or smaller than the guessed number.
